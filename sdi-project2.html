<p>I chose to continue my story from project 1 and add a check function to my loadcells for a floor scale, and if one or more is greater than 8mV, the code would output a bad reading and cell.</p>
<p>Loadcells are usually around 1-4 mV deadload and at around 6 or 7 is on the high side, 8 to 15 mV would need replacement. What this mean is loadcell has a range from the low end to the high end,
   usually from 1 to 30 mV. Since the deadload (weight of deck, base, hopper) can weigh differently, some can have a deadload reading of up to 10mV. Not in this case, we are measuring floor scale loadcells.</p>
<p> High teens readings are definitely bad, it would be out of range. Example, if a scale has 20mV deadload, it would then only have 10mv left. So if the scale has a capacity of 5000 lb, the actually capacity would
   probably now only be around 2000 - 3000 lb, because it lost most of it's low range and would top out a lot earlier. </p>
